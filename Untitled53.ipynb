    "A practical example of when nominal encoding would be preferred over one-hot encoding is when encoding a customer's rating of a product. The rating can be one of five possible values: \"1 star\", \"2 stars\", \"3 stars\", \"4 stars\", or \"5 stars\". In this case, the order of the ratings does not matter, so nominal encoding would be preferred."
